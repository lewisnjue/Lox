1. Pick an open source implementation of a language you like. Download
the source code and poke around in it. Try to find the code that
implements the scanner and parser. Are they handwritten, or generated
using tools like Lex and Yacc? (.l or .y files usually imply the latter.)
2. Just-in-time compilation tends to be the fastest way to implement
dynamically typed languages, but not all of them use it. What reasons
are there to not JIT?
3. Most Lisp implementations that compile to C also contain an
interpreter that lets them execute Lisp code on the fly as well. Why?
